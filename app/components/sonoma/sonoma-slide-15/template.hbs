          Watershed models suggest that ground-water recharge, which refills aquifers, is a much more reliable source of water for the region than surface-water runoff which fills reservoirs. Groundwater aquifers are a much larger water supply than reservoirs, but reliable only when effectively managed.

          From 1920-2009 the Russian River watershed had slightly more runoff than recharge. Climate projections show runoff varies greatly for different simulations; recharge is a much less variable water supply.
