        <p class="content">The extreme drought which California has been in for 5+ years cannot be remedied quickly, and it is important to know that not all high rainfall events can efficiently decrease the drought conditions in the soils in the landscape.</p>
        <p class="content">When we get a lot of rain, itâ€™s often during warm weather, the plants soak up the rainwater and less goes into the soil.  The soil and ground need hydration in order to build back up our ground-water supply.  What accumulates is called Climate Water Deficit.</p>
